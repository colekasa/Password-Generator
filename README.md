# Password-Generator

    My first project using Javascript and applying what I have learned is the Password Generator. This will determine a random password for you after you have set the parameters yourself. I have created this password generators Javascript with very little starter code and have left some comments if anybody is looking over it to try and understand what it is. I would love for anyone to go ahead and try as many possible scenarios as they can and contact me if they see a fix that can be helpful or make the code more efficient. Please have fun making a random password and allowing the javascript to do the work for you!
